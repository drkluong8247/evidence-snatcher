<h2>Evidence Snatcher</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Play as a police officer, looking for evidence to arrest a notorious criminal.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The player can collect evidence of the crime boss's criminal activity, but must also beware of his henchmen.
This requires the player to steathily obtain evidence, and then leave the area in order to use the evidence.
The player will have to balance the risks of staying too long and guaranteeing an arrest, or leaving early without enough evidence.
</li>
    
<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Platformer
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
Use the arrow keys to move. Collect as many clues as needed, but avoid the bad guys.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
This prototype will aim to have random generation of clues, moving enemies, and a method usable by the player to "end" the game. Player movement will occur easily. Because the player is investigating, shooting is not an action allowed. Shooting all the bad guys seems to be going overboard with the investigation.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
There will be 3 factors working against the player, one of which is the bad guys moving around. The second factor is the timer, which will serve as a means of declaring the maximum amount of time the player has to gather clues. If the player exceeds this time limit, the crime boss will get away. However, instead of creating a set number of incriminating evidence, the player can choose to decide how much evidence is necessary. A percentage indicator will show the success rate of being able to arrest the crime boss and lock him behind bars. The player can choose to leave before it reads 100% if time is an issue, but bad luck could potentially create a lose situation.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
In some city located somewhere in the world, there is a rather peaceful environment to the average visitor. However, this peaceful outlook hides the sinister intents of a person living within it...
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
As a member of the police department, you, along with your colleagues, are trying frantically to pinpoint the actions of a criminal who has taken residence in your peaceful town. He's responsible for several crimes, but so far, the police have no hints as to where he lives, or even what he looks like. Evidence left at the crime scene is often not helpful, so even if you knew who the new criminal was, it would be unlikely that you would be able to arrest him, since his henchmen do most of the work. However, by a twist of fate, you happen to find a suspicious looking building and after infiltrating, you realize that you've managed to find the crime boss's base of operations. You set about trying to find evidence so you can arrest the criminal, but be warned. The crime boss has managed to stay undetected because he constantly switches his base's location. If you take too long, this chance will slip through your fingers.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
With its simplistic controls, but somewhat advanced mechanics, this would have to be played by someone at least 9 years or older. This game is perfect for people who prefer evading enemies as opposed to attacking them.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
90 seconds max.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Move fast, the timer starts as soon as the game loads. Touching an enemy kills you instantly.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
MS Paint was used to make the background, characters, attacks, and enemies from scratch.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Borrowed from the Phaser Example - tanks for movement, but no shooting in this game.
